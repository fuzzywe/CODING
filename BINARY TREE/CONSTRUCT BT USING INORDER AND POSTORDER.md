106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/description/

Given two integer arrays inorder and postorder where inorder is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Input: inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Example 2:

Input: inorder = [-1], postorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]
