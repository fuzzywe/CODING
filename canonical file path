To transform a Unix-style file path into its simplified canonical form, we need to handle the following:

Single period (.): It represents the current directory and should be ignored.
Double period (..): It represents moving up one directory level, so we should remove the previous directory from the path.
Multiple slashes (//): They should be treated as a single slash (/).
Here's how you can implement the solution in C++:

Approach:
Split the path into components based on the slashes (/).
Use a stack to store the valid directory names.
If the component is "..", pop the top of the stack (move up one level).
If the component is "." or empty, skip it.
Otherwise, push the component onto the stack.
Rebuild the path from the stack, separating each component with a single slash (/).
Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <sstream>
using namespace std;

string simplifyPath(string path) {
    stack<string> dirs;  // Stack to store valid directories
    stringstream ss(path);
    string token;

    while (getline(ss, token, '/')) {
        if (token == "." || token == "") {
            // Current directory or multiple slashes, skip
            continue;
        } else if (token == "..") {
            // Move up one directory level, pop if stack is not empty
            if (!dirs.empty()) {
                dirs.pop();
            }
        } else {
            // Valid directory name, push onto the stack
            dirs.push(token);
        }
    }

    // Rebuild the canonical path
    string result = "";
    while (!dirs.empty()) {
        result = "/" + dirs.top() + result;
        dirs.pop();
    }

    // Return "/" if the result is empty, otherwise return the result
    return result.empty() ? "/" : result;
}

int main() {
    string path = "/./a/./b//c./d/.";
    cout << simplifyPath(path) << endl;  // Output: "/a/b/c./d"
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Input: We process the string "/./a/./b//c./d/." by splitting it at each /.
Stack Operations:
Skip . and empty parts caused by multiple slashes (//).
If we encounter "..", pop the stack to move up a directory.
For valid directory names, push them onto the stack.
Rebuilding the Path: Once we process the entire string, we rebuild the path from the stack.
Example Walkthrough:
For the input path "/./a/./b//c./d/.":

Step 1: Split into tokens: ["", ".", "a", ".", "b", "", "c.", "d", "."]
Step 2: Skip . and empty strings, push a, b, c., and d onto the stack.
Step 3: Rebuild the path: /a/b/c./d.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time complexity: 

O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the length of the input path, because we are processing each character once.
Space complexity: 

O(n), for the stack that holds the directory names.
