Here are some related problems to finding the median of two sorted arrays that you might find interesting:

1. **Kth Element of Two Sorted Arrays**:
   - Find the k-th smallest element in the union of two sorted arrays.

2. **Median of a Single Sorted Array**:
   - Compute the median of a single sorted array, which is simpler than the two-array case.

3. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays**:
   - Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array (not specifically for median, but foundational).

4. **Find the Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays**:
   - Determine the common elements in two sorted arrays.

5. **Find the Union of Two Sorted Arrays**:
   - Find the unique elements present in either of the two sorted arrays.

6. **Closest Pair in Sorted Arrays**:
   - Given two sorted arrays, find the pair of elements (one from each array) whose sum is closest to a given target.

7. **Find the Mode in Two Sorted Arrays**:
   - Determine the mode(s) (most frequently occurring element) in the union of two sorted arrays.

8. **Count Distinct Elements in Two Sorted Arrays**:
   - Count the number of distinct elements present in the combined sorted arrays.

9. **Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted**:
   - Given a sorted array, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

10. **Median of a Stream**:
    - Maintain the median of a continuously incoming stream of numbers, which can involve managing two heaps.

These problems build on similar concepts of array manipulation, searching, and partitioning, making them good practice for improving your problem-solving skills in algorithms and data structures.
