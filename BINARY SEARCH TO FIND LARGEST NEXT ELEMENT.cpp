he goal is to use binary search to minimize the time complexity. Here's how we can approach it:

Binary Search Logic:

If the middle element is less than or equal to the target, the next larger element must be to the right of the middle.
If the middle element is greater than the target, then it might be the answer, but we also need to check the left side for a potentially smaller valid element.
Return Value:

After the binary search completes, if a valid candidate has been found, we return it.
If no such number exists (i.e., the target is larger than or equal to all elements in the sequence), return an indicator (like -1).
Binary Search Code to Find the Largest Next Number:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int findNextLargest(const vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
    int result = -1;  // To store the answer

    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;  // To avoid overflow

        // If the middle element is greater than target, it could be a candidate
        if (nums[mid] > target) {
            result = nums[mid];  // Potential candidate
            high = mid - 1;  // Move to the left side to check for smaller valid numbers
        }
        // If the middle element is less than or equal to the target, discard left half
        else {
            low = mid + 1;  // Move to the right side
        }
    }

    return result;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 5, 9, 13, 20};  // Sorted array
    int target = 5;

    int nextLargest = findNextLargest(nums, target);
    
    if (nextLargest != -1) {
        cout << "The smallest number greater than " << target << " is: " << nextLargest << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No number greater than " << target << " exists in the array." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The function findNextLargest takes a sorted vector nums and a target value target.
It uses binary search to find the smallest number that is greater than the target.
If the middle element is greater than the target, it's a potential answer, and we move to the left half
of the array to see if there's a smaller number that's still larger than the target.
If the middle element is less than or equal to the target, we move to the right half of the array.
The variable result keeps track of the potential answer, and after the search is completed, it's returned.
Example:
    arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14] and target 7:

The initial middle is arr[3] = 8, which is greater than 7, so res = 8, and we move to the left half (low = 0, high = 2).
Now, the middle is arr[1] = 4, which is less than 7, so we move to the right half (low = 2, high = 2).
Now, the middle is arr[2] = 6, which is less than 7, so we move to the right (low = 3).
The search ends because low > high. The result is 8.

For the array nums = {1, 2, 5, 9, 13, 20} and target = 5:

The smallest number greater than 5 is 9.
The output will be:
csharp
Copy code
The smallest number greater than 5 is: 9
Time Complexity:
Time complexity: 

O(logn), where 
ùëõ
n is the number of elements in the array.
This is because we're using binary search, which halves the search space in each step.
Space complexity: 

O(1) because we're not using any additional data structures that depend on the input size (only a few variables).
