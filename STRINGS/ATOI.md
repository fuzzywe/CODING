Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer.

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

Whitespace: Ignore any leading whitespace (" ").
Signedness: Determine the sign by checking if the next character is '-' or '+', assuming positivity if neither present.
Conversion: Read the integer by skipping leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If no digits were read, then the result is 0.
Rounding: If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then round the integer to remain in the range. Specifically, integers less than -231 should be rounded to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be rounded to 231 - 1.
Return the integer as the final result.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "42"

Output: 42

Explanation:

The underlined characters are what is read in and the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
Example 2:

Input: s = " -042"

Output: -42

Explanation:

Step 1: "   -042" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -042" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -042" ("042" is read in, leading zeros ignored in the result)
               ^
Example 3:

Input: s = "1337c0d3"

Output: 1337

Explanation:

Step 1: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "1337c0d3" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "1337c0d3" ("1337" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
Example 4:

Input: s = "0-1"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Step 1: "0-1" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "0-1" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "0-1" ("0" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
          ^
Example 5:

Input: s = "words and 987"

Output: 0

Explanation:

Reading stops at the first non-digit character 'w'.

Given a string s, the objective is to convert it into integer format without utilizing any built-in functions. Refer the below steps to know about atoi() function.

Cases for atoi() conversion:

Skip any leading whitespaces.
Check for a sign (‘+’ or ‘-‘), default to positive if no sign is present.
Read the integer by ignoring leading zeros until a non-digit character is encountered or end of the string is reached. If no digits are present, return 0.
If the integer is greater than 231 – 1, then return 231 – 1 and if the integer is smaller than -231, then return -231.
Examples:

Input: s = "-123"
Output: -123
Explanation: It is possible to convert -123 into an integer so we returned in the form of an integer
Input: s = "  -"
Output: 0
Explanation: No digits are present, therefore the returned answer is 0.
Input: s = " 1231231231311133"
Output: 2147483647
Explanation: The converted number will be greater than 231 – 1, therefore print 231 – 1 = 2147483647.
Input: s = "-999999999999"
Output: -2147483648
Explanation: The converted number is smaller than -231, therefore print -231 = -2147483648.
Input: s = "  -0012gfg4"
Output: -12
Explanation: Nothing is read after -12 as a non-digit character ‘g’ was encountered.


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(const char *s) {
        // Initialize variables
        bool positive = true;
        int i = 0;
        
        // Check for leading '-' for negative numbers
        if (s[0] == '-') {
            i++;
            positive = false;
        }

        int ans = 0;

        // Iterate through the characters in the string
        for (; s[i] != '\0'; i++) {
            if (i == 0 && s[i] == '-') continue;
            if (s[i] == ' ') continue;
            if (!isDigit(s[i])) return -1; // Return -1 if a non-digit character is encountered

            // Convert character to integer and update `ans`
            ans = ans * 10 + (s[i] - '0');
        }
        
        // Return the answer, accounting for the sign
        return positive ? ans : -ans;
    }

private:
    bool isDigit(char c) {
        // Check if character is a digit
        return c >= '0' && c <= '9';
    }
};

```
