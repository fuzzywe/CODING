Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

 ```cpp
Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> numSet(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int longest = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (numSet.find(num - 1) == numSet.end()) {
                int length = 1;

                while (numSet.find(num + length) != numSet.end()) {
                    length++;
                }

                longest = max(longest, length);
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
};
```
