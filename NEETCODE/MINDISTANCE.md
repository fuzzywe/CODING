Let's dry run the given code to understand how it works. The function is designed to compute the minimum number of operations (insert, delete, or replace) required to convert word1 into word2. This is a dynamic programming solution to the Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance) problem.

Example:

Letâ€™s dry run with word1 = "horse" and word2 = "ros".

Initialization:

m = 5 (length of "horse")

n = 3 (length of "ros")

Create a 2D dp table of size (m+1) x (n+1) to store the minimum operations. Each dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to convert the first i characters of word1 into the first j characters of word2.


Step 1: Initialize dp table

The first row and first column are initialized based on the operations required when one of the strings is empty:

dp[i][0] = i means converting the first i characters of word1 to an empty string requires i deletions.

dp[0][j] = j means converting an empty string to the first j characters of word2 requires j insertions.



Step 2: Fill the DP Table

We now proceed with filling the table by considering each character from both words. For each i, j:

If word1[i-1] == word2[j-1], no operation is needed, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].

If word1[i-1] != word2[j-1], we take the minimum of the three operations (replace, delete, insert) and add 1.


Iteration 1:

For i = 1, j = 1 ("h" vs "r"):

Characters don't match (word1[0] != word2[0]), so:

dp[1][1] = min(dp[0][0], dp[0][1], dp[1][0]) + 1

dp[1][1] = min(0, 1, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2



For i = 1, j = 2 ("h" vs "o"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[1][2] = min(dp[0][1], dp[0][2], dp[1][1]) + 1

dp[1][2] = min(1, 2, 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3



For i = 1, j = 3 ("h" vs "s"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[1][3] = min(dp[0][2], dp[0][3], dp[1][2]) + 1

dp[1][3] = min(2, 3, 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4



Iteration 2:

For i = 2, j = 1 ("o" vs "r"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[2][1] = min(dp[1][0], dp[1][1], dp[2][0]) + 1

dp[2][1] = min(1, 2, 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3



For i = 2, j = 2 ("o" vs "o"):

Characters match (word1[1] == word2[1]), so:

dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] = 2



For i = 2, j = 3 ("o" vs "s"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[2][3] = min(dp[1][2], dp[1][3], dp[2][2]) + 1

dp[2][3] = min(3, 4, 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3



Iteration 3:

For i = 3, j = 1 ("r" vs "r"):

Characters match, so:

dp[3][1] = dp[2][0] = 2



For i = 3, j = 2 ("r" vs "o"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[3][2] = min(dp[2][1], dp[2][2], dp[3][1]) + 1

dp[3][2] = min(3, 2, 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3



For i = 3, j = 3 ("r" vs "s"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[3][3] = min(dp[2][2], dp[2][3], dp[3][2]) + 1

dp[3][3] = min(2, 3, 3) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3



Iteration 4:

For i = 4, j = 1 ("s" vs "r"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[4][1] = min(dp[3][0], dp[3][1], dp[4][0]) + 1

dp[4][1] = min(3, 2, 4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3



For i = 4, j = 2 ("s" vs "o"):

Characters don't match, so:

dp[4][2] = min(dp[3][1], dp[3][2], dp[4][1]) + 1

dp[4][2] = min(2, 3, 3) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3



For i = 4, j = 3 ("s" vs "s"):

Characters match, so:

dp[4][3] = dp[3][2] = 3
