875. Koko Eating Bananas
Solved
Medium
Topics
Companies
Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.

 

Example 1:

Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
Example 3:

Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23


```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = 1;
        for(int pile : piles){
            right = max(right, pile);
        }
        
        while(left<right) {
            int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
            int hours = 0;
            for(int pile: piles){
                hours += ceil(pile*1.0/mid);
            }
            if(hours<=h){
                right = mid;
            }
            else {
                left = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```
**can you explain why we did this Math.ceil(pile*1.0/mid)
why multiplied by 1.0

I think it's for casting the pile into double instead of int for the proper ceil calculation.**
This code solves the **Koko Eating Bananas** problem, where you are given a list of piles of bananas and a number `h`, representing the number of hours. The task is to find the minimum eating speed `k` (bananas per hour) such that Koko can finish all the piles within `h` hours. The solution uses **binary search** to optimize the search for the eating speed.

Let’s go through the code line-by-line with an example.

### **Code Explanation**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minEatingSpeed(vector<int>& piles, int h) {
```
- **Class Definition**: This defines a class named `Solution`.
- **Function Definition**: The `minEatingSpeed` function takes a vector `piles` of integers (representing the number of bananas in each pile) and an integer `h` (the number of hours) as input. It returns an integer representing the minimum eating speed `k` that allows Koko to finish all bananas in `h` hours.

---

```cpp
int left = 1;
int right = 1;
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `left`: The minimum possible eating speed is `1` banana per hour.
  - `right`: We will update this to represent the maximum possible eating speed.

---

```cpp
for(int pile : piles){
    right = max(right, pile);
}
```
- **Explanation**: This loop iterates through the `piles` array to find the maximum pile size. The maximum possible eating speed is the size of the largest pile because Koko could eat all the bananas in that pile in one hour if she ate at the maximum speed.
  
#### Example:
- Suppose `piles = {3, 6, 7, 11}`:
  - Initially, `right = 1`
  - After the loop:
    - `right = max(1, 3) = 3`
    - `right = max(3, 6) = 6`
    - `right = max(6, 7) = 7`
    - `right = max(7, 11) = 11`
  - So, the possible range for Koko's eating speed is between `1` and `11`.

---

```cpp
while(left < right) {
```
- **Explanation**: This is the start of the binary search loop. The loop continues as long as `left` is less than `right`, meaning there is still a range to search within for the optimal eating speed.

---

```cpp
int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
```
- **Explanation**: This calculates the middle value between `left` and `right`. The middle value `mid` represents a candidate eating speed that we are testing to see if Koko can finish all piles within `h` hours.
  
#### Example:
- For the first iteration, if `left = 1` and `right = 11`, then:
  - `mid = 1 + (11 - 1) / 2 = 6`
  - We will now check if Koko can finish all bananas at the speed of `6` bananas per hour.

---

```cpp
int hours = 0;
for(int pile : piles){
    hours += ceil(pile * 1.0 / mid);
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `hours` is used to keep track of the total number of hours Koko needs to finish all piles at the current speed `mid`.
  - This loop calculates how many hours it will take for Koko to eat each pile of bananas at the speed `mid`.
  - For each pile, the time is `ceil(pile / mid)`, which is the ceiling of the division because Koko can only eat whole bananas, so any remaining fraction of a pile takes another hour.

#### Example with `mid = 6`:
- For `piles = {3, 6, 7, 11}`:
  - For `pile = 3`, `ceil(3 / 6) = 1` hour
  - For `pile = 6`, `ceil(6 / 6) = 1` hour
  - For `pile = 7`, `ceil(7 / 6) = 2` hours
  - For `pile = 11`, `ceil(11 / 6) = 2` hours
  - Total `hours = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6` hours.

---

```cpp
if(hours <= h){
    right = mid;
}
```
- **Explanation**: If the total hours (`hours`) calculated is less than or equal to `h`, it means Koko can finish all the bananas at this speed. Hence, we reduce the upper bound (`right = mid`) to search for a potentially slower eating speed that could also work.

#### Example:
- If `hours = 6` and `h = 8`, then Koko can finish the bananas within `h` hours at the speed of `6`. So, we update `right = mid = 6` to check for a slower speed.

---

```cpp
else {
    left = mid + 1;
}
```
- **Explanation**: If `hours > h`, it means Koko cannot finish the bananas in `h` hours at the current speed `mid`. Therefore, we need to increase the eating speed, so we set `left = mid + 1`.

#### Example:
- If `hours = 9` and `h = 8`, then Koko cannot finish the bananas within `h` hours at speed `6`. So, we update `left = mid + 1 = 7`.

---

```cpp
}
```
- **Explanation**: End of the `while` loop. The binary search continues until `left` is no longer less than `right`.

---

```cpp
return left;
```
- **Explanation**: At the end of the binary search, `left` will contain the minimum speed at which Koko can eat all the bananas in exactly `h` hours or less. This is the answer.

#### Example:
- Suppose the binary search converges with `left = 6`. Then, the minimum speed Koko can eat all the bananas in `h = 8` hours is `6` bananas per hour.

### **Full Example Dry Run:**

Let’s dry run this code with the following example:

#### Input:
- `piles = {3, 6, 7, 11}`
- `h = 8`

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - `left = 1`, `right = 11`
   - `totalSum = 27`
   
2. **First Iteration** (`left = 1`, `right = 11`):
   - `mid = (1 + 11) / 2 = 6`
   - For `mid = 6`, calculate `hours`:
     - `ceil(3 / 6) = 1`
     - `ceil(6 / 6) = 1`
     - `ceil(7 / 6) = 2`
     - `ceil(11 / 6) = 2`
   - Total `hours = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6` hours, which is less than `h = 8`.
   - Update `right = 6`.

3. **Second Iteration** (`left = 1`, `right = 6`):
   - `mid = (1 + 6) / 2 = 3`
   - For `mid = 3`, calculate `hours`:
     - `ceil(3 / 3) = 1`
     - `ceil(6 / 3) = 2`
     - `ceil(7 / 3) = 3`
     - `ceil(11 / 3) = 4`
   - Total `hours = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` hours, which is more than `h = 8`.
   - Update `left = 4`.

4. **Third Iteration** (`left = 4`, `right = 6`):
   - `mid = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5`
   - For `mid = 5`, calculate `hours`:
     - `ceil(3 / 5) = 1`
     - `ceil(6 / 5) = 2`
     - `ceil(7 / 5) = 2`
     - `ceil(11 / 5) = 3`
   - Total `hours = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8` hours, which is equal to `h = 8`.
   - Update `right = 5`.

5. **Fourth Iteration** (`left = 4`, `right = 5`):
   - `mid = (4 + 5) / 2 = 4`
   - For `mid = 4`, calculate `hours`:
     - `ceil(3 / 4) = 1`
     - `ceil(6 / 4) = 2`
     - `ceil(7 / 4) = 2`
     - `ceil(11 / 4) = 3`
   - Total `hours = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8` hours, which is equal to `h = 8`.
   - Update `right = 4`.

6. **Exit Loop**: Now `left = right = 4`, so the loop exits, and the answer is `4`.
