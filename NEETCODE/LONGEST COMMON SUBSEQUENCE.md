Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(nâˆ—m)
n is length of text1 and m is length of text2

Space complexity: O(n)
For dp list with length of text1

 ```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        vector<int> dp(text1.length(), 0);
        int longest = 0;

        for (char c : text2) {
            int curLength = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < dp.size(); i++) {
                if (curLength < dp[i]) {
                    curLength = dp[i];
                } else if (c == text1[i]) {
                    dp[i] = curLength + 1;
                    longest = max(longest, curLength + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return longest;        
    }
};
```
