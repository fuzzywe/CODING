Number of Provinces

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/description/

Problem Statement: Given an undirected graph with V vertices. We say two vertices u and v belong to a single province if there is a path from u to v or v to u. Your task is to find the number of provinces.

There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

Output: 2

Time Complexity: O(N) + O(V+2E), Where O(N) is for outer loop and inner loop runs in total a single DFS over entire graph, and we know DFS takes a time of O(V+2E). 

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(N),Space for recursion stack space and visited array.
