Let's solve the problem step by step, considering both the brute force and optimized solutions for encoding a string such that consecutive repeating characters are compressed to the character followed by the count.

Problem:
Given a string, compress repeated letters. For example, for input "abccaddeeeeeaa", the output should be "abc2ad2e5a2".

Brute Force Solution
Approach:
Initialize an empty result string.
Traverse the string one character at a time and keep track of consecutive characters.
For each character, if itâ€™s different from the previous one, append it to the result. If it's the same, keep a count of how many times it repeats.
When a new character is encountered or the end of the string is reached, append the count (if greater than 1) next to the character in the result string.
Code (Brute Force - C++):
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string compressString(const string &s) {
    string result = "";
    int n = s.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Add current character to the result
        result += s[i];
        int count = 1;
        
        // Count consecutive occurrences of the current character
        while (i + 1 < n && s[i] == s[i + 1]) {
            count++;
            i++;
        }
        
        // Append count if greater than 1
        if (count > 1) {
            result += to_string(count);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abccaddeeeeeaa";
    cout << "Compressed String: " << compressString(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Time Complexity:
We are traversing the string only once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Space Complexity:
We are using an additional string to store the result, which grows in proportion to the input string. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).
Optimized Solution
Approach:
The brute force approach is already efficient in terms of time complexity because we are traversing the string once. But to optimize the space usage, we can avoid using a separate result string. Instead, we can modify the input string in place if allowed. This optimization is common when the input size is small or we want to minimize extra memory usage.

Code (Optimized - C++):
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string compressString(string &s) {
    if (s.empty()) return "";

    string result;
    int n = s.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result += s[i];
        int count = 1;
        
        // Count consecutive occurrences of the current character
        while (i + 1 < n && s[i] == s[i + 1]) {
            count++;
            i++;
        }
        
        // Append the count if greater than 1
        if (count > 1) {
            result += to_string(count);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string s = "abccaddeeeeeaa";
    cout << "Compressed String: " << compressString(s) << endl;
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
The optimized approach is similar to the brute-force method in terms of logic.
It avoids unnecessary use of space by storing the result directly into the same input string (if allowed). Alternatively, you can also use a separate result string like in the brute-force solution.
In-place modification is often an optimization when memory usage is critical.
Time Complexity:
The time complexity remains O(n) since we still need to traverse the string once.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) for the result string, but if we modify the input string in place, the extra space usage is constant, i.e., O(1).
Summary of Time and Space Complexity:
Approach	Time Complexity	Space Complexity
Brute Force	O(n)	O(n)
Optimized	O(n)	O(1) (if in-place) or O(n)
Both approaches have the same time complexity, but the optimized version can save space if done in-place.

Example Walkthrough:
For input: "abccaddeeeeeaa"

The algorithm starts with the first character 'a' (count = 1).
The next character is 'b' (count = 1).
For 'c', it counts 2 consecutive occurrences, so it becomes "c2".
For 'a', it counts 1.
For 'd', it counts 2.
For 'e', it counts 5 consecutive occurrences, so it becomes "e5".
For 'a', it counts 2.
The final result is: "abc2ad2e5a2"
