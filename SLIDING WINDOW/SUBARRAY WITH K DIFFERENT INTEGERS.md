992. Subarrays with K Different Integers

https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers/description/

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of good subarrays of nums.

A good array is an array where the number of different integers in that array is exactly k.

For example, [1,2,3,1,2] has 3 different integers: 1, 2, and 3.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.


 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly 2 different integers: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,3], [1,2,1], [2,1,2], [1,2,1,2]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Subarrays formed with exactly 3 different integers: [1,2,1,3], [2,1,3], [1,3,4].

We are given an array of integers nums and an integer k. The task is to count the number of contiguous subarrays that contain exactly k distinct integers.

Key Observations:

A "good subarray" is defined as a contiguous subarray that contains exactly k distinct elements.
There can be duplicate elements present in the nums array.
Approach 1: Sliding Window
Intuition
The brute force method involves finding all the subarrays and then selecting those subarrays that have exactly k distinct integers. However, this approach becomes costly in terms of time complexity, reaching O(n 
2
 ).

For a more efficient approach, let's use the sliding window pattern. This pattern can be applied when the problem entails achieving a goal using subarrays, and individual elements cannot be independently selected.

The concept behind the sliding window pattern is to maintain a window that continuously expands from the right by adding elements until the condition is met. Once the condition is satisfied, we adjust the window by shrinking it from the left until the condition is met again.

For each valid window, we can calculate the total number of subarrays it can form using the formula right - left + 1. This represents the number of subarrays ending at the current element (right) and starting anywhere from the current left boundary (left) to the right pointer (right) (inclusive).

Once the window contains more than k distinct elements, we start shrinking it from the left side. We remove the element at the leftmost position and update the set of distinct elements. This process continues until the window size becomes valid again for the condition.

Another crucial realization is that the subarrays exceeding the k distinct integers are irrelevant to our objective. We focus on subarrays whose distinct integers are either equal to k or less than k.

The calculation right - left + 1, counts the subarrays with at most k distinct integers.

After calculating the total count of subarrays with distinct integers less than or equal to k using slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k), we need to isolate the subarrays that strictly meet the target k.

This can be achieved by subtracting the total count of subarrays with distinct integers less than k (slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k - 1)) from the total count obtained earlier. By subtracting the latter from the former, we essentially remove the subarrays that don't reach k and are left with only the subarrays that have exactly k distinct integers.

Consider nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] and k = 2.

slidingWindowAtMost(nums, 2) will count all subarrays (12) with at most 2 distinct elements (including those with exactly 2 and 1).
slidingWindowAtMost(nums, 1) will count all subarrays (5) with at most 1 distinct element.

The difference, slidingWindowAtMost(nums, 2) - slidingWindowAtMost(nums, 1), removes subarrays with 1 distinct element, leaving only those with exactly 2, which is our answer (7).

Refer to the visual slideshow demonstrating the sliding window on slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k).

Now, refer to the visual slideshow demonstrating the sliding window on slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k - 1).

Refer to the below Venn diagram for a better understanding of how subtracting slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k - 1) from slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k) gives exactly k distinct elements.

Algorithm
The slidingWindowAtMost function is responsible for counting the subarrays with at most distinctK distinct elements.

Initialize an empty freqMap to store the frequency of elements in the current window.
Initialize left and totalCount to 0.
Iterate through the nums array using the right pointer:
Increment the frequency of nums[right] in the freqMap.
While the size of freqMap (the number of distinct elements) is greater than distinctK:
Decrement the frequency of nums[left] in the freqMap.
If the frequency of nums[left] becomes 0, remove it from the freqMap.
Increment left to shrink the window.
Add right - left + 1 to totalCount. This counts the number of subarrays ending at right with at most distinctK distinct elements.
Return totalCount.
The subarraysWithKDistinct function calls the slidingWindowAtMost function twice, once with k and once with k - 1, and subtracts the result of the latter from the result of the former to get the exact k distinct elements.

Implementation
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int subarraysWithKDistinct(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        return slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k) - slidingWindowAtMost(nums, k - 1);
    }

private:
    // Helper function to count the number of subarrays with at most k distinct elements.
    int slidingWindowAtMost(vector<int>& nums, int distinctK) {
        // To store the occurrences of each element.
        unordered_map<int, int> freqMap;
        int left = 0, totalCount = 0;

        // Right pointer of the sliding window iterates through the array.
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
            freqMap[nums[right]]++;

            // If the number of distinct elements in the window exceeds k,
            // we shrink the window from the left until we have at most k distinct elements.
            while (freqMap.size() > distinctK) {
                freqMap[nums[left]]--;
                if (freqMap[nums[left]] == 0) 
                    freqMap.erase(nums[left]);
                left++;
            }

            // Update the total count by adding the length of the current subarray.
            totalCount += (right - left + 1);
        }
        return totalCount;
    }
};
```
Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the nums array.

Time complexity: O(n)

The time complexity is O(n) because the slidingWindowAtMost function iterates through the array once using the sliding window technique, and each element is processed at most twice (once when it enters the window and once when it exits the window). Inside the loop, the operations of updating the frequency map and shrinking the window take O(1) time on average, assuming the underlying hash table implementation has constant-time operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input array.

Space complexity: O(n)

The space complexity is O(n) due to the use of the freqMap to store the frequency of elements in the current window. In the worst case, when all elements in the array are distinct, the freqMap will store all the elements, resulting in a space complexity of O(n).

It's important to note that the space complexity is also affected by the underlying implementation of the hash table used for the freqMap. Some implementations may have additional overhead, leading to a slightly higher space complexity.

Approach 2: Sliding Window in One Pass
Intuition
When we create a subarray with an element, we can add k - 1 additional distinct elements to the subarray without invalidating it.

If we subtract 1 from k when we encounter a new element, when k becomes zero, it means we have exactly k distinct elements in the current window. At this point, we need to count the number of valid subarrays we can form with these k distinct elements within the window.

However, if k becomes negative, it indicates that there are more than k distinct elements in the current window. We need to adjust the window from the left side by moving the left pointer and reducing the frequency of nums[left] until the number of distinct elements is valid again (equal to k).

If there are duplicates of nums[left] within the current window, we need to keep shrinking the window from the left side until the frequency of nums[left] is zero. This is crucial because we need to maintain the correct count of distinct elements within the window.

Now if k has become 0 and if the frequency of nums[left] is greater than 1, it means there are duplicates of the current left. For each duplicate, we increment currCount, which represents the number of subarrays that can be formed by including these duplicates along with the distinct elements in the current window.

Once we find the smallest subarray with exactly k distinct elements, we can add currCount + 1 to totalCount. The 1 is added to include the current subarray formed by the k distinct elements within the window.

By continuously adjusting the window and counting subarrays when we have exactly k distinct elements, we can find the total count of valid subarrays with at most k distinct elements in just a single pass.

Refer to the visual slideshow demonstrating the sliding window in one pass.

Current

Algorithm
Initialize an array distinctCount of size nums.size() + 1 to store the count of distinct values encountered.

Initialize totalCount to 0, which will store the total count of subarrays with k distinct elements.

Initialize left and right pointers to 0, representing the sliding window.

Initialize currCount to 0, which will store the count of subarrays with the current distinct elements.

Start the sliding window approach by iterating through the nums array using the right pointer:

Increment the count of the element at nums[right] in the distinctCount array.
If the count changes from 0 to 1, it means a new distinct element is encountered, so decrement k.
If k becomes negative, it means there are more than k distinct elements in the current window:
Move the left pointer until the count of distinct elements becomes valid again by decrementing the count of nums[left] in the distinctCount array and incrementing k.
Reset currCount to 0.
If k becomes 0, it means there are exactly k distinct elements in the current window:
While there are duplicate elements (count > 1) in the window, move the left pointer, decrement the count of nums[left] in the distinctCount array, and increment currCount.
Add currCount + 1 to totalCount.
Increment right to move the sliding window.
After the loop, return totalCount, which holds the total count of subarrays with k distinct elements.

        int right = 0;
        int currCount = 0;

        while (right < nums.size()) {
            // Increment the count of the current element in the window
            if (++distinctCount[nums[right++]] == 1) {
                // If encountering a new distinct element, decrement K
                k--;
            }

            if (k < 0) {
                // Move the left pointer until the count of distinct elements

                k++;
                currCount = 0;
            }

            if (k == 0) {
                // While the count of left remains greater than 1, keep
                // shrinking the window from the left
                while (distinctCount[nums[left]] > 1) {
                    --distinctCount[nums[left++]];
                    currCount++;
                }
                // Add the count of subarrays with k distinct elements to the
                // total count
                totalCount += (currCount + 1);
            }

Complexity Analysis
Let n be the length of the nums array.

Time complexity: O(n)

The time complexity is O(n) because the algorithm iterates through the array once using the sliding window technique, and each element is processed at most twice (once when it enters the window and once when it exits the window), resulting in linear time complexity.

Space complexity: O(n)

The space complexity is also O(n) because the algorithm uses a mapping array to store the count of distinct elements encountered in the current window. In the worst case, this array can grow to the size of the input array; hence, the space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input.
