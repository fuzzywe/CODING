To solve the problem where you convert numbers from 1 to n into their binary representations and count the total number of 1s in all those binary representations, the approach is fairly straightforward.

We can iterate from 1 to n, convert each number to binary, and then count the number of 1s in that binary string.

Example Walkthrough:
Let's say the input is n = 5:

1 in binary: 1 → 1 occurrence of '1'
2 in binary: 10 → 1 occurrence of '1'
3 in binary: 11 → 2 occurrences of '1'
4 in binary: 100 → 1 occurrence of '1'
5 in binary: 101 → 2 occurrences of '1'
So, the total count of 1s in the binary representations of numbers from 1 to 5 is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7.

C++ Code Implementation:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Function to count the number of 1's in binary representation of numbers from 1 to n
int countTotalOnes(int n) {
    int totalOnes = 0;

    // Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int num = i;
        
        // Count number of 1's in binary representation of the current number
        while (num > 0) {
            totalOnes += (num & 1); // Increment count if last bit is 1
            num >>= 1; // Right shift to process the next bit
        }
    }
    
    return totalOnes;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;
    
    int result = countTotalOnes(n);
    cout << "Total number of 1's in binary representations from 1 to " << n << " is: " << result << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Binary Representation: For each number i from 1 to n, we count the number of 1s in its binary form.
We use bitwise operations to check each bit of the number.
The expression (num & 1) checks if the least significant bit (LSB) of num is 1.
We then right shift the number by 1 using num >>= 1, which moves the bits to the right, effectively dividing the number by 2.
Summation: The total number of 1s is accumulated by summing the counts for each number from 1 to n.
Time Complexity:
The time complexity for each number is O(log i) where i is the number being processed, as we are inspecting each bit of the number.
The total time complexity for all numbers from 1 to n is O(n log n) since the maximum number of bits in a number n is approximately log n.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) as we only need a few variables to store the current number, count, and result.
Example Output:
For n = 5:

csharp
Copy code
Total number of 1's in binary representations from 1 to 5 is: 7
For n = 10:

csharp
Copy code
Total number of 1's in binary representations from 1 to 10 is: 17
This solution efficiently counts the total number of 1s in the binary representations of all numbers from 1 to n.

n the brute force approach, we directly convert each number from 1 to n into its binary form, treat the binary number as a string, and then count the number of 1s in that binary string.

Example Walkthrough:
For n = 5, the binary representations are:

1 in binary: 1 → 1 occurrence of '1'
2 in binary: 10 → 1 occurrence of '1'
3 in binary: 11 → 2 occurrences of '1'
4 in binary: 100 → 1 occurrence of '1'
5 in binary: 101 → 2 occurrences of '1'
The total number of 1s: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7.

Brute Force C++ Code:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;

int countTotalOnesBruteForce(int n) {
    int totalOnes = 0;

    // Loop through all numbers from 1 to n
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        // Convert the number to binary and store it in a string
        string binary = bitset<32>(i).to_string();

        // Count the number of '1's in the binary string
        for (char bit : binary) {
            if (bit == '1') {
                totalOnes++;
            }
        }
    }

    return totalOnes;
}

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> n;

    int result = countTotalOnesBruteForce(n);
    cout << "Total number of 1's in binary representations from 1 to " << n << " is: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
Explanation:
Binary Conversion: For each number i from 1 to n, we convert the number to a 32-bit binary string using the bitset<32>(i).to_string() function. This function generates a 32-bit binary string for the number.
Counting 1s: We loop over the characters in the binary string and count the number of 1s.
Summation: The total count of 1s is calculated for all numbers from 1 to n.
Brute Force Time Complexity:
Binary Conversion: Each number is converted to a 32-bit string, which is independent of the actual number of bits in the number.
Counting 1s: For each number, we loop through a 32-bit binary string, resulting in a time complexity of O(32) = O(1) per number.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the input number.
Brute Force Space Complexity:
We use O(32) space for each binary string, which is O(1) space overall. The total space complexity is O(1) apart from input and output.
Example Output:
For n = 5:

csharp
Copy code
Total number of 1's in binary representations from 1 to 5 is: 7
For n = 10:

csharp
Copy code
Total number of 1's in binary representations from 1 to 10 is: 17
Conclusion:
The brute force approach is simple but not as efficient as the optimized one, as it processes the binary representation as a string of 32 bits for each number, irrespective of how many actual bits the number has.
Time complexity is O(n), and space complexity is O(1).
