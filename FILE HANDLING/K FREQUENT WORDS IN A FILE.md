To find the **most k frequent words** in a file in Python, you can follow these steps:

1. **Read the file** and extract all words.
2. **Count the frequency** of each word.
3. **Sort the words** based on frequency.
4. **Retrieve the top k frequent words**.

Here is a Python code that demonstrates this approach:

```python
from collections import Counter
import re

def most_k_frequent_words(filename, k):
    # Open the file
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        # Read the entire file content
        text = file.read()
    
    # Use regular expression to extract words and convert them to lowercase
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text.lower())
    
    # Count the frequency of each word using Counter
    word_count = Counter(words)
    
    # Get the k most frequent words
    most_common = word_count.most_common(k)
    
    # Return the list of top k frequent words and their counts
    return most_common

# Example usage
filename = 'sample.txt'  # Replace with your file path
k = 5  # Get top 5 most frequent words
result = most_k_frequent_words(filename, k)

# Print the result
for word, count in result:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

### **Explanation of Each Line of Code:**

1. **`from collections import Counter`**: 
   - The `Counter` class from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each word in the file. It provides a dictionary-like object where the keys are the elements (words), and the values are their counts.

2. **`import re`**:
   - The `re` module is used for regular expressions. It helps us extract words from the text.

3. **`def most_k_frequent_words(filename, k):`**:
   - This function takes two arguments: `filename` (the path to the file) and `k` (the number of most frequent words to find).

4. **`with open(filename, 'r') as file:`**:
   - Opens the file in read mode. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after reading.

5. **`text = file.read()`**:
   - Reads the entire content of the file into a string variable `text`.

6. **`words = re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', text.lower())`**:
   - This regular expression extracts words from the text. The pattern `\b\w+\b` matches sequences of word characters (letters, digits, underscores) surrounded by word boundaries. The `text.lower()` ensures that the words are counted in a case-insensitive manner.

7. **`word_count = Counter(words)`**:
   - The `Counter` object `word_count` holds the frequency of each word in the list `words`. It counts how many times each word appears.

8. **`most_common = word_count.most_common(k)`**:
   - The `most_common(k)` method of `Counter` returns the `k` most common elements and their counts as a list of tuples, sorted by frequency in descending order.

9. **`return most_common`**:
   - The function returns the top `k` most frequent words along with their frequency.

### **Example:**

Let's say the content of the file `sample.txt` is:

```
apple banana apple cherry banana apple banana date apple
```

Running the function with `k=3` would return the top 3 most frequent words:

```python
result = most_k_frequent_words('sample.txt', 3)
for word, count in result:
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

### **Output**:

```
apple: 4
banana: 3
cherry: 1
```

### **Mathematical Explanation**:
- **Word frequency counting**: We use a **hash map** (implemented via `Counter`) to store word counts. For each word, the count is incremented by 1. 
- **Finding the top k frequent words**: After counting the frequencies, we use the `most_common(k)` method, which sorts the words by their frequency in **descending order** and returns the first `k` words.

### **Optimizations**:
- The regular expression helps to efficiently extract words and handles punctuation well.
- The **time complexity** is dominated by reading the file and counting word frequencies, which is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of characters in the file.
- Sorting the words by frequency is **O(m log m)**, where `m` is the number of unique words. Since `k` is typically much smaller than `m`, this is usually efficient.

This method is efficient for finding the most frequent words, even in large files.
