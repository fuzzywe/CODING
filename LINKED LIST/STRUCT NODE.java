class Node {
public:
    int data;         // Data of the node
    Node* next;       // Pointer to the next node in the list
    // Constructor for a node with both data and next node provided
    Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }
    // Constructor for a node with only data provided, next initialized to nullptr
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        
        next = nullptr;
    }
}; why i ne4ed to use this

The design of your Node class with two constructors provides flexibility in how nodes are created in a linked list. Let's break down why each constructor is useful:

1. First Constructor:
cpp
Copy code
Node(int data1, Node* next1) {
    data = data1;
    next = next1;
}
Why it's needed: This constructor allows you to create a node and immediately link it to another node. It initializes both the data and next pointer at the same time.

When to use:

When you already know the next node and want to link the current node to it at the time of creation.
It reduces the number of steps needed to create a node and link it to another node, making the code more concise.
Example use case: Let's say you're building a linked list by chaining nodes together. You can directly link a new node to an existing one:

cpp
Copy code
Node* third = new Node(30, nullptr);  // Create third node, no next node (end of list)
Node* second = new Node(20, third);   // Create second node, link to third
Node* first = new Node(10, second);   // Create first node, link to second
Benefits:

Saves time by reducing the need to separately set the next pointer after creating the node.
Makes code easier to read and maintain when linking nodes at creation.
2. Second Constructor:
cpp
Copy code
Node(int data1) {
    data = data1;
    next = nullptr;
}
Why it's needed: This constructor is used when you only have the data value for the node but don't know or don't need to specify the next node immediately. It initializes the next pointer to nullptr, which is typical when you're creating a new node that is currently the end of the list.

When to use:

When you're creating a node that will either be the first node in the list or the last node (for now).
When the next node will be linked later in the code, allowing you to handle node connections incrementally.
Example use case: Let's say you're adding nodes one at a time to the end of a linked list:

cpp
Copy code
Node* head = new Node(10);  // First node, next is nullptr
Node* second = new Node(20);
head->next = second;        // Manually link the first node to the second node
Benefits:

It simplifies node creation when you don't immediately know what the next pointer should be.
Often used for initial node creation, especially when setting up the head of a linked list.
Why You Need Both Constructors:
Flexibility:
The first constructor is useful when you already have a linked structure and want to insert nodes while linking them at the same time.
The second constructor is essential for incremental construction of a linked list, especially when you're building it step by step.
Convenience:
The first constructor lets you create and link nodes in one go, reducing redundancy in your code.
The second constructor helps when you don’t yet know what the next node should be, or when you're adding nodes to the list later.
Summary:
First Constructor: Use this when you want to create a node and immediately set its next pointer. It’s convenient for creating linked nodes in a single step.
Second Constructor: Use this when you’re only creating the node and don’t yet know or want to set its next pointer. It’s useful for creating nodes when they are not immediately linked.
Having both constructors provides the versatility to handle different scenarios when managing linked lists, improving your code's flexibility and readability.


WHITHOUT THE STRUCT AND CLASS NODE THE CODE WILL BE LIKE:

// Function to insert a new element at the end of the linked list
void insertAtEnd(int*& head, int x) {
    // Create a new node dynamically
    // Here we simulate the node structure using an array
    int* newNode = new int[2]; // New node with two elements: data and pointer to next

    newNode[0] = x;     // Store data
    newNode[1] = NULL;  // Initialize next pointer to NULL

    // If the list is empty, make newNode the head
    if (head == NULL) {
        head = newNode;  // Assign newNode to head
        return;
    }

    // Traverse to the last node
    int* last = head;  // Start from the head
    while (last[1] != NULL) {
        last = (int*)(last[1]);  // Move to the next node
    }

    // Link the new node at the end of the list
    last[1] = newNode;  // Set the last node's next to newNode
}

// Function to print the linked list
void printList(int* head) {
    int* node = head;
    while (node != NULL) {
        cout << node[0] << " ";  // Print data part
        node = (int*)(node[1]);   // Move to next node
    }
    cout << "\n";
}
