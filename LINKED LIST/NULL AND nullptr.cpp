what is the difference between temp!= NULL and temp!= nullptr


  NULL
Type: Integer constant (usually defined as 0).
Definition: #define NULL 0 (typically). 
Purpose: Historically used to represent a null pointer, but can also represent an integer 0.
Type-Safety: Not type-safe. It can introduce ambiguity because NULL is just an integer.
Usage: Can be used as both a null pointer and an integer, which may confuse the compiler in some cases (especially with overloaded functions).
nullptr
Type: std::nullptr_t (introduced in C++11).
Definition: A keyword designed specifically to represent a null pointer.
Purpose: Unambiguously represents a null pointer, making it clearer and more type-safe.
Type-Safety: Type-safe. It's guaranteed to be treated as a pointer type, preventing confusion between integers and pointers.
Usage: Preferred in modern C++ (C++11 and beyond) because it avoids the ambiguity associated with NULL.
Key Differences:
Type: NULL is an integer constant (0), whereas nullptr is of type std::nullptr_t (a null pointer type).
Ambiguity: NULL can cause ambiguity (e.g., when passed to overloaded functions) because it's just 0. nullptr is unambiguous and always treated as a null pointer.
Preferred Use: nullptr is the recommended way to represent null pointers in modern C++ for clarity and safety.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
void func(int x) {
    std::cout << "Called func with int\n";
}

void func(int* x) {
    std::cout << "Called func with pointer\n";
}

int main() {
    func(NULL);     // Could call either func(int) or func(int*)
    func(nullptr);  // Clearly calls func(int*) because nullptr is a pointer
}
NULL could lead to confusion because itâ€™s just 0, while nullptr explicitly refers to a null pointer.




The main difference between temp != NULL and temp != nullptr lies in their types and the intent behind their usage in C++.

1. NULL:
Type: NULL is traditionally defined as 0 in C++.
Definition: It's a macro (usually defined in the standard library headers as #define NULL 0).
Purpose: It's used to represent a null pointer but technically can also be used for an integer 0.
Limitation: Since NULL is just an integer literal (0), there can be ambiguity. For instance, in function overloads, it's sometimes not clear if NULL is intended to represent an integer or a pointer.
Example:

cpp
Copy code
int* temp = NULL;  // Equivalent to int* temp = 0;
2. nullptr:
Type: nullptr is a keyword introduced in C++11 specifically for null pointers.
Definition: nullptr is of type std::nullptr_t, which is a specific type designed to represent null pointers.
Purpose: nullptr is type-safe and always refers to a null pointer, unlike NULL, which could be confused with an integer.
Advantage: nullptr avoids the ambiguity that NULL introduces in function overloads or comparisons.
Example:

cpp
Copy code
int* temp = nullptr;  // Directly represents a null pointer
Key Differences:
Type-Safety:

NULL: Can be treated as an integer 0, so it can sometimes introduce ambiguity (e.g., in function overload resolution).
nullptr: It's a dedicated null pointer constant, which eliminates ambiguity between null pointers and integers.
Modern Usage:

nullptr: Should be preferred in modern C++ (post-C++11) because it's type-safe and explicitly meant for pointers.
NULL: Legacy, and still works, but nullptr is the preferred option.
Example to illustrate the difference:
cpp
Copy code
void func(int x) {
    std::cout << "Called func with int\n";
}

void func(int* x) {
    std::cout << "Called func with pointer\n";
}

int main() {
    func(NULL);     // Ambiguous, could call either func(int) or func(int*)
    func(nullptr);  // Clearly calls func(int*) because nullptr is explicitly a pointer
}
When using NULL, the compiler may struggle to decide which overload to call because NULL is just 0, and 0 can be interpreted as either an integer or a null pointer.
When using nullptr, the compiler knows you're dealing with a null pointer, so it will call the pointer overload.
Conclusion:
Use nullptr in modern C++ code (C++11 and beyond) for better type safety and clarity.
NULL is outdated but still usable in older codebases. However, nullptr is the recommended approach moving forward to avoid ambiguity and ensure clearer intent.
