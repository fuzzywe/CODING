In C++, both struct and class are used to define user-defined types. While they are very similar, there are a few key differences between struct and class, primarily in terms of default access specifiers and intended usage.

1. Default Access Specifiers:
struct: In a struct, members (variables and functions) are public by default. This means that if you don't explicitly specify access levels, everything inside a struct is accessible outside the structure.
class: In a class, members are private by default. You must explicitly make members public to allow access from outside the class.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
struct NodeStruct {
    int data;  // public by default
    NodeStruct* next;  // public by default
};

class NodeClass {
    int data;  // private by default
    NodeClass* next;  // private by default

  public:
    NodeClass(int x) {  // public constructor
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
In the above example:

In NodeStruct, both data and next are public, meaning any code outside the struct can directly access these members.
In NodeClass, data and next are private by default. They can only be accessed through public member functions or by explicitly specifying public.
2. Intended Usage:
struct: Traditionally, struct is used for plain data structures that mainly hold data, and they often don't have much behavior (functions).
class: class is typically used for more complex objects that not only store data but also have behaviors (methods/functions) and encapsulation. It follows the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), such as encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Example of Encapsulation in Class:

cpp
Copy code
class Node {
  private:
    int data;
    Node* next;

  public:
    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }

    int getData() {
        return data;  // Only accessible through this method
    }
};
In this Node class, the data member is private and can only be accessed through the getData() function, demonstrating encapsulation.

3. Object-Oriented Programming:
struct: Although struct can have member functions and constructors/destructors, its usage in OOP is less common. It's typically used for plain old data (POD) structures, similar to C-style structs.
class: class is designed for full OOP, supporting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
4. Inheritance:
struct: If you inherit from a struct, the inheritance is public by default.
class: If you inherit from a class, the inheritance is private by default.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
struct BaseStruct { };
struct DerivedStruct : BaseStruct { };  // public inheritance by default

class BaseClass { };
class DerivedClass : BaseClass { };  // private inheritance by default
Summary of Differences:

Feature                                          struct	                                            class

Inheritance type	                               Public by default	                                Private by default
  
Common in OOP	Less common,                       more for simple data holding	More common            for full OOP functionality




In modern C++, struct and class can be used interchangeably, and the choice often comes down to coding style and clarity.
However, if you're writing object-oriented code with encapsulation, inheritance, and methods, class is typically the preferred choice. 
If you're simply grouping data without much behavior, struct is often used.
