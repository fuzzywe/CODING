```

Your approach to **reversing a linked list** using a **stack** is a valid one, though it's not the most optimal in terms of space complexity. Let’s break it down step by step so you can explain it impressively in an interview.

---

### 🔹 **Understanding the Problem**  
You are given a **singly linked list**, and the goal is to reverse it.  

**Example:**  
```
Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

🔹 **Approach Used**: **Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)**
- A stack follows **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** order.  
- We first push all the values from the linked list into the stack.
- Then, we **pop** values from the stack and reassign them to the linked list nodes, effectively reversing the list.

---

## 🔹 **Step-by-Step Explanation**
### **Step 1: Create a Temporary Pointer**
```cpp
ListNode* temp = head;
```
- We create a pointer `temp` and set it to `head`.  
- This pointer will be used to traverse the linked list.

### **Step 2: Create a Stack to Store Values**
```cpp
stack<int> st;
```
- We initialize an empty **stack** (`st`) to store the values of the linked list.

### **Step 3: Traverse the Linked List and Push Values into Stack**
```cpp
while (temp != nullptr) {
    st.push(temp->val);  
    temp = temp->next;    
}
```
- We iterate through the linked list.
- For each node, we push its `val` into the stack.
- **Example Execution for List [1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5]:**
  - Push `1`, stack = `[1]`
  - Push `2`, stack = `[1, 2]`
  - Push `3`, stack = `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Push `4`, stack = `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Push `5`, stack = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- At the end of this loop, the stack holds values in **reverse order**.

### **Step 4: Reset temp to Head**
```cpp
temp = head;
```
- We reset `temp` to `head` so we can traverse the linked list again.

### **Step 5: Pop Values from Stack and Reassign to Nodes**
```cpp
while (temp != nullptr) {
    temp->val = st.top();  
    st.pop();              
    temp = temp->next;     
}
```
- Now, we iterate through the linked list **again**.
- For each node, we:
  1. Assign `temp->val = st.top()` (retrieve top value from stack).
  2. `st.pop()` (remove the top value).
  3. Move `temp` to the next node.
- **Example Execution (Rewriting Values):**
  - `temp->val = 5`, stack becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - `temp->val = 4`, stack becomes `[1, 2, 3]`
  - `temp->val = 3`, stack becomes `[1, 2]`
  - `temp->val = 2`, stack becomes `[1]`
  - `temp->val = 1`, stack becomes `[]`
- Now, the list is reversed.

### **Step 6: Return the Reversed Linked List**
```cpp
return head;
```
- We return the head of the modified linked list.

---

## 🔹 **Complexity Analysis**
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - `O(N)`: Traversing the linked list takes `O(N)`.  
  - `O(N)`: Reassigning values takes `O(N)`.  
  - Total: **O(N) + O(N) = O(N)**.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - **O(N)** (Because of the extra stack storing `N` values).

---

## 🔹 **Alternative Optimized Approach (In-Place Reversal)**
Instead of using a **stack**, we can reverse the list **in-place** using **three pointers**:  
- `prev`: Tracks the previous node  
- `curr`: Tracks the current node  
- `next`: Stores the next node temporarily  



---

## 🔹 **How to Impress in an Interview**
### **🔹 If Asked Why You Used a Stack:**
- **Explain the intuition:**  
  "A stack follows **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**, which naturally helps in reversing the order of elements."
- **Justify your choice:**  
  "By using a stack, we can retrieve values in reversed order without modifying the original structure until reassignment."

### **🔹 If Asked About Space Complexity:**
- "This approach uses **O(N) extra space** because the stack stores all the node values."
- "A more efficient approach would be **reversing the pointers in place**, reducing space to **O(1)**."

### **🔹 If Asked About Edge Cases:**
- **Empty List (`head == nullptr`)** → Returns `nullptr` (Handled automatically).  
- **Single Node (`1 -> nullptr`)** → Remains unchanged.  
- **Already Reversed List (`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`)** → Still works correctly.  

---

## 🔹 **Final Takeaway**
🔹 The **stack approach** is intuitive and simple but uses **extra space**.  
🔹 **In-place reversal using pointers** is the **best approach** for efficiency.  
🔹 Be ready to **explain time/space complexity** and **compare different solutions**.  

This explanation will help you **impress interviewers** with your deep understanding! 🚀💡

Your code implements **recursive reversal** of a singly linked list. This is an elegant and efficient approach that does not require extra data structures like a stack. Let’s break it down **step by step** for an impressive interview explanation. 🚀  

---

## 🔹 **Understanding the Approach**
Instead of using iteration, **recursion** is used to reverse the list. The key idea is:
1. **Base Case**: If the list is empty (`head == NULL`) or has only one node (`head->next == NULL`), return `head` as it's already reversed.
2. **Recursive Call**: The function calls itself on `head->next`, reversing the rest of the list.
3. **Backtracking Phase**: Once recursion reaches the last node, it starts **reversing** the links.
4. **Updating Pointers**: The `next` node (`front`) is set to point to `head`, effectively reversing the link.
5. **Breaking the Old Link**: `head->next` is set to `NULL` to avoid cycles.
6. **Returning the New Head**: The new head (`temp`) is returned up the recursion stack.

---
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if(head== NULL || head->next == NULL) return head;
        ListNode* temp= reverseList(head->next);
        ListNode* front = head->next;
        front->next = head;
        head->next = NULL;
        return temp;
    }
};

```

## 🔹 **Step-by-Step Explanation**
Consider the **input linked list**:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

### **Step 1: Base Case**
```cpp
if(head == NULL || head->next == NULL) return head;
```
- If the list is empty (`head == NULL`) or has only **one node**, return `head`.  
- This ensures that recursion stops when it reaches the last node.

---

### **Step 2: Recursive Call**
```cpp
ListNode* temp = reverseList(head->next);
```
- We recursively call `reverseList` on the **next node** (`head->next`).  
- The recursion continues until it reaches the **last node**, which becomes the new `head`.

#### **Recursive Calls Breakdown**
| Function Call      | `head`  | `head->next` |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| `reverseList(1)`  | `1` → `2` | Calls `reverseList(2)` |
| `reverseList(2)`  | `2` → `3` | Calls `reverseList(3)` |
| `reverseList(3)`  | `3` → `4` | Calls `reverseList(4)` |
| `reverseList(4)`  | `4` → `5` | Calls `reverseList(5)` |
| `reverseList(5)`  | `5` → `NULL` | **Base case reached, returns `5`** |

At this point, the recursion **starts returning back up**.

---

### **Step 3: Backtracking (Reversing the Links)**
Once recursion reaches the end, it starts **reversing the links** as it **unwinds**.

```cpp
ListNode* front = head->next;  // Store next node
front->next = head;  // Reverse the link
```
- `front` is the next node (`head->next`).
- We **reverse** the link: `front->next = head`.

**Execution on Unwinding:**
| Current `head` | `front` (head->next) | New Link (`front->next`) |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| `4` → `5`    | `5`                | `5` → `4`        |
| `3` → `4`    | `4`                | `4` → `3`        |
| `2` → `3`    | `3`                | `3` → `2`        |
| `1` → `2`    | `2`                | `2` → `1`        |

Now, the list becomes:
```
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

---

### **Step 4: Breaking the Old Link**
```cpp
head->next = NULL;
```
- Since `head` is now at the end of the reversed list, we set `head->next = NULL` to avoid cycles.

---

### **Step 5: Returning the New Head**
```cpp
return temp;
```
- `temp` is the new head (`5`), and we return it up the recursion stack.

---

## 🔹 **Final Execution Flow**
1. `reverseList(1)` calls `reverseList(2)`
2. `reverseList(2)` calls `reverseList(3)`
3. `reverseList(3)` calls `reverseList(4)`
4. `reverseList(4)` calls `reverseList(5)`
5. `reverseList(5)` **returns `5`** (base case met)
6. `reverseList(4)` reverses the link: `5 → 4`, returns `5`
7. `reverseList(3)` reverses the link: `4 → 3`, returns `5`
8. `reverseList(2)` reverses the link: `3 → 2`, returns `5`
9. `reverseList(1)` reverses the link: `2 → 1`, returns `5`

Now the list is reversed.

---

## 🔹 **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**
| Complexity | Analysis |
|------------|----------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(N)** → Each node is visited once |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(N)** → Due to recursion stack |

## 🔹 **How to Impress in an Interview**
### 🔹 **If Asked Why You Used Recursion**
- "Recursion follows **function call stack (LIFO)**, naturally reversing the linked list."
- "It makes the code clean and elegant, leveraging **backtracking**."

### 🔹 **If Asked About Space Complexity**
- "The recursive approach takes **O(N) space** due to the recursion stack."
- "An iterative approach is **better** for space efficiency (`O(1)`)."

### 🔹 **If Asked to Compare Recursion vs Iteration**
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Pros | Cons |
|----------|---------------|---------------|------|------|
| **Recursive** | `O(N)` | `O(N)` (stack space) | Elegant & short | Extra space due to recursion |
| **Iterative** | `O(N)` | `O(1)` | Memory efficient | Slightly more complex to write |

### 🔹 **Edge Cases to Mention**
✔️ **Empty list (`NULL`)** → Returns `NULL`.  
✔️ **Single node (`1 -> NULL`)** → Remains unchanged.  
✔️ **Already reversed (`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`)** → Still works correctly.

```cpp

    class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        // Initialize pointers
        ListNode* prev = nullptr; // Previous node starts as NULL
        ListNode* next = nullptr; // Next node
        ListNode* curr = head;    // Current node starts at the head

        // Traverse the list
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            // Save the next node
            next = curr->next;

            // Reverse the link
            curr->next = prev;

            // Move pointers forward
            prev = curr; // Move prev to the current node
            curr = next; // Move curr to the next node
        }

        // prev is now the new head of the reversed list
        return prev;
    }
};


```

Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), because we reversed the linked list in a single pass, where 𝑛 n is the number of nodes in a linked list.

Space complexity:
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), because no extra memory is used.
