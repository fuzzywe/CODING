Two Sum : Check if a pair with given sum exists in Array



Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] and an integer target.

1st variant: Return YES if there exist two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, return NO.

2nd variant: Return indices of the two numbers such that their sum is equal to the target. Otherwise, we will return {-1, -1}.

Note: You are not allowed to use the same element twice. Example: If the target is equal to 6 and num[1] = 3, then nums[1] + nums[1] = target is not a solution.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 14
Result: YES (for 1st variant)
       [1, 3] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: arr[1] + arr[3] = 14. So, the answer is “YES” for the first variant and [1, 3] for 2nd variant.

Example 2:
Input Format: N = 5, arr[] = {2,6,5,8,11}, target = 15
Result: NO (for 1st variant)
	[-1, -1] (for 2nd variant)
Explanation: There exist no such two numbers whose sum is equal to the target.

  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] == target) return "YES";
        }
    }
    return "NO";
}

int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
    int target = 14;
    string ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
    cout << "This is the answer for variant 1: " << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
Output: This is the answer for variant 1: YES

Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the array.
Reason: There are two loops(i.e. nested) each running for approximately N times.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

vector<int> twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    vector<int> ans;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[i] + arr[j] == target) {
                ans.push_back(i);
                ans.push_back(j);
                return ans;
            }
        }
    }
    return { -1, -1};
}

{
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
    int target = 14;
    vector<int> ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
    cout << "This is the answer for variant 2: [" << ans[0] << ", "
         << ans[1] << "]" << endl;
    return 0;
}
Output: This is the answer for variant 2: [1, 3]

Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the array.

  #include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

string twoSum(int n, vector<int> &arr, int target) {
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
        if (sum == target) {
            return "YES";
        }
        else if (sum < target) left++;
        else right--;
    }
    return "NO";
}

int main()
{
    int n = 5;
    vector<int> arr = {2, 6, 5, 8, 11};
    int target = 14;
    string ans = twoSum(n, arr, target);
    cout << "This is the answer for variant 1: " << ans << endl;
    return 0;
}
Output: This is the answer for variant 1: YES

Note: For variant 2, we can store the elements of the array along with its index in a new array. Then the rest of the code will be similar. And while returning, we need to return the stored indices instead of returning “YES”. But for this variant, the recommended approach is approach 2 i.e. hashing approach.

Time Complexity: O(N) + O(N*logN), where N = size of the array.
Reason: The loop will run at most N times. And sorting the array will take N*logN time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
