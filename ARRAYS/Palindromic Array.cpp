Palindromic Array
Examples:

Input: arr[] = [111, 222, 333, 444, 555]
Output: true
Explanation:
arr[0] = 111, which is a palindrome number.
arr[1] = 222, which is a palindrome number.
arr[2] = 333, which is a palindrome number.
arr[3] = 444, which is a palindrome number.
arr[4] = 555, which is a palindrome number.
As all numbers are palindrome so This will return true.
Input: arr[] = [121, 131, 20]
Output: false
Explanation: 20 is not a palindrome hence the output is false.
Expected Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
