Here are some important **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problems where a similar approach (often just slight modifications) can solve different problem variations. This list highlights problems that share concepts like 1D/2D DP array usage, counting, or tracking specific values in grids or sequences.

### 1. **1D/2D Array Counting Problems**
These problems often require counting subarrays, subsequences, or submatrices with specific properties, and slight variations in counting logic or result tracking can adapt the solution to multiple problems.

- **Count Square Submatrices with All Ones** - Count all submatrices with only `1`s.
- **Maximal Square** - Find the largest square with only `1`s and return its area.
- **Largest Rectangle in Histogram** - Identify the largest rectangular area in a histogram (similar logic used in maximal submatrices).
- **Count Submatrices with All Ones** - Variants like "count rectangular submatrices," focusing on maximum width/height submatrices.

### 2. **Knapsack Variants**
Knapsack DP problems are widely applicable with minimal changes in logic or constraints.

- **0/1 Knapsack** - Standard knapsack with item choice constraints.
- **Subset Sum Problem** - Check if a subset sums up to a target (similar to knapsack but only with the target check).
- **Partition Equal Subset Sum** - Divide the array into two subsets with equal sums.
- **Target Sum** - Find ways to assign `+` and `-` signs to achieve a target sum, very similar to knapsack partitioning.
  
### 3. **Longest Increasing Subsequences (LIS) and Variants**
These involve tracking increasing subsequences but can adapt to slightly different constraints.

- **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** - Find the longest subsequence with increasing values.
- **Longest Bitonic Subsequence** - Find the longest subsequence first increasing, then decreasing.
- **Longest Consecutive Subsequence** - Find the longest consecutive sequence (in elements or indexes).
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** - Longest subsequence that is common between two strings (similar logic of subsequence formation).

### 4. **Edit Distance Variants**
DP on string modification problems often share underlying logic.

- **Edit Distance** - Minimum edits (insert, delete, replace) to convert one string to another.
- **Longest Palindromic Subsequence** - Longest subsequence that is a palindrome.
- **Longest Palindromic Substring** - Similar to palindromic subsequences, but focuses on substring continuity.
- **Minimum Insertions to Form a Palindrome** - Modifying the edit distance problem to add minimal insertions.

### 5. **Grid Pathfinding Problems**
Problems focusing on finding paths or minimum costs in grids share DP table usage.

- **Unique Paths** - Count ways to reach the bottom-right corner of an `m x n` grid.
- **Unique Paths II** (with obstacles) - Same as above but with cells blocked (handling obstacles like `0`).
- **Minimum Path Sum** - Find the path with the smallest sum of values in each cell.
- **Cherry Pickup** - Collect the maximum cherries in a grid while following movement constraints, similar to other grid pathfinding problems with cumulative maximums.
  
### 6. **Stock Trading Problems**
These involve decision-making at each price point, sharing logic for maximizing profit with constraints.

- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** - Find the max profit from a single buy-sell.
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II** - Multiple transactions allowed, but no overlapping transactions.
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee** - Include a fixed fee in each transaction.
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown** - Include cooldown periods after each sale.
  
### 7. **Fibonacci Variants**
DP problems where each state is dependent on previous states, similar to the Fibonacci sequence.

- **Climbing Stairs** - Number of ways to reach the `n`th stair.
- **House Robber** - Maximum money from non-adjacent houses (like Fibonacci, where you skip terms).
- **House Robber II** (circular) - Similar to House Robber, but houses are in a circular arrangement.
- **Decode Ways** - Count the number of ways to decode a message, similar to Fibonacci by moving 1 or 2 steps.

### 8. **Palindrome Subsequence/Substring Problems**
Problems that involve finding or forming palindromic subsequences or substrings are often solvable by a similar approach.

- **Longest Palindromic Subsequence** - Longest palindromic subsequence in a string.
- **Longest Palindromic Substring** - Longest palindromic substring (continuous).
- **Minimum Insertions to Make a String Palindrome** - Minimum insertions to make the string a palindrome.
- **Minimum Deletions to Make a String Palindrome** - Similar to insertions but with deletions.

These problems are connected by similar state definitions in DP, and with minor logic modifications, you can adapt a solution from one problem to solve another.
